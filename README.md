## Lattice-Boltzmann-Method-Simulations

### Fluid flow simulations using LBM:
- The simplified Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook(BGK) collision operator
- Single Relaxation Time(SRT)

### FLUID FLOW simulated in the following scenarios-
- LID DRIVEN CAVITY: the west, south and east walls of the closed cavity have NO SLIP boundary condition. The north wall(again NO SLIP) is a lid moving at a constant velocity. The evolution of the flow, from rest to the formation of vortices can be observed here: [streamlines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE1NLxs7Bco) and [velocity contour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSxDkA_-h_E).
- SURFACE MOUNTED OBSTACLE IN A CHANNEL: A channel is continuous and never ending with an inlet(West boundary) and an outlet(East boundary). Here, we mount(fixed) an obstacle(square, prism, cylinder, etc.) on the lower(South) wall. Initially, the fluid is at rest with a constant horizontal velocity(u=U,v=0) at the inlet. The evolution of the flow before and after hitting the obstacle can be found here: [streamlines](https://youtu.be/r0EiZOo425k) and [velocity contour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO3vcvUXPAY).
- FLOW AROUND A CYLINDER IN A CHANNEL: In this case, we have a cylinder placed in the center of the channel flow(left to right). Initially, inlet has a parabolic velocity profile with maximum velocity at the center and zero at both the upper and lower walls. The formation of alternating vortices and eventually vortex shedding can be observed: [streamlines](https://youtu.be/r0EiZOo425k) and [velocity contour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO3vcvUXPAY)
