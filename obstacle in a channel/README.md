### FLOW AROUND CYLINDER IN A CHANNEL
## Contents
- The paper implemented: Investigating flow patterns in a channel with obstacles
- Simulation code: flowAroundObstacle.py (run $ python3 cavity.py)
- Animation codes: animate.py(animates streamlines of the simulation), contour.py(animates velocity contour)
- Other: fft.py(calculates the FFT of velocity time series in the wake behind the obstacle), drag.py(calculates drag and lift coefficients of the flow)
